# BlenderFilmStudio real-Blender lab journal

This is a continuous laboratory record for experiments executed against the actual local Blender binary. Retrospective entries are reconstructed only from committed machine-readable evidence; live entries are written before or during the experiment.

The persistent method for this goal is versioned in `research/RESEARCH_CHARTER.md`. The charter requires real Blender execution, pre-registered gates, negative cases, preserved falsification, machine-readable evidence, explicit non-claims and public verification.

## J-001 · SceneSpec → BuildPlan → real Blender compiler

Type: retrospective, reconstructed from `experiments/compiler-v0-1/results.json`.

Hypothesis: a canonical SceneSpec can compile to one immutable BuildPlan, and two clean Blender processes can create semantically identical scenes.

Real execution: Blender 5.2 loaded the pinned B01/B02 `.blend` libraries, authored cameras/lights/render settings and saved new `scene.blend` files twice per benchmark.

Observation:

- B01 plan: `316114f10d4ec3a2b9e6b569e39476a143fc1b1db10e1603ba54d37dc73c3eaf`
- B01 structure: `c699fc27230d8dc378a9d4e6aa23a6425cc7007c0ee33a3172b6928f8e1b7f0b`
- B02 plan: `a9022bf6f881b1c8d7b7866813d22454c81f72de9190e05af82c10bf62a26687`
- B02 structure: `025c6fa50dcacef3c6c30ea9ec7ed97ce09bce0a9f51157887bc73c3981fa856`
- both A/B structure comparisons passed;
- both A/B `.blend` byte hashes differed;
- tampered BuildPlans were rejected.

Verdict: semantic structure reproducibility passed; `.blend` binary reproducibility was falsified and is not used as the semantic gate.

## J-002 · Actor, contact and articulated grasp

Type: retrospective, reconstructed from B03–B05 experiment artifacts.

Real execution: Blender opened the B03/B04 character rigs, evaluated gaze, face Shape Keys, foot/contact samples, armature constraints and two-finger IK, then compiled B05 through the same scene compiler.

Observation:

- B03 structure: `96041c22a6626b4c5aceff3cc74155d5be411cfe0142f3025ecdf2d86d84d5ff`
- B05 structure: `a21c1e8944c50e528270cc314afbfe186a8d727ab5fb0dd0b4a8b078b4d315df`
- B05 automation: 8/8 negative cases passed;
- human perceptual gates remain separate from geometric automation.

Verdict: typed rig/contact/grasp compilation is technically executable, but “natural acting” and photoreal skin/contact remain unproven.

## J-003 · Physics solve versus immutable replay

Type: retrospective, reconstructed from B06–B08 artifacts.

Hypothesis: one rigid-body solve might reproduce exactly in repeated Blender runs.

Observation: B06 falsified exact source-solve reproducibility. B07 therefore froze an individually evaluated trajectory, and B08 compiled it as immutable kinematic replay.

- B08 plan: `7a4bccb640130db2dbf5c315907f81d5462605b6939b00a9df672c362d544dd9`
- B08 structure: `46898404f12905d9fb1c31b7a3694a41b1d951cb688a15654a4dae084fe3077d`
- 132 frames: position error `0`, rotation error `0`;
- 8/8 trajectory tamper cases rejected.

Verdict: source physics remains a reviewed upstream process; deterministic compilation consumes the approved trajectory rather than silently re-solving it.

## J-004 · Path and appended-asset security

Type: retrospective, reconstructed from B10/B11 attack JSON.

Real execution: harmless symlink/path escape cases were presented to the Node compiler, and hash-valid `.blend` fixtures carrying Blender drivers, Shape Key drivers, constraints, rigid bodies, actions, linked libraries and overrides were appended by Blender 5.2.

Observation:

- B10 first run exposed six path/symlink escapes; after remediation 8/8 cases were rejected;
- B11 first run compiled hidden evaluation behavior;
- after typed post-append inspection, 9/9 B11 cases were rejected;
- nine existing assets were inventoried; six exact B03/B04 head/gaze rig constraints form the narrow allowlist.

Verdict: byte hash, path identity and Blender evaluation structure are three separate integrity layers.

## J-005 · Restricted process resource budget

Type: live experiment completed 2026-08-26; evidence in `experiments/resource-budget-v0-1/results.json`.

Hypothesis: a local Codex/CLI supervisor can fail closed on measured resource budgets without changing B01 semantics.

Real execution: Blender sleep/log fixtures and the real B01 compiler were launched as OS child processes. Local Node fixtures exercised file-count, output-byte, RSS and non-zero-exit cases.

Observation:

- six pre-registered cases produced `WALL_TIME`, `LOG_BYTES`, `OUTPUT_FILES`, `OUTPUT_BYTES`, `RSS_BYTES` and `CHILD_FAILED` as expected;
- five over-budget processes received SIGTERM and were awaited;
- B01 restricted compile: `555 ms`, sampled peak RSS `253,476,864 B`, log `1,109 B`, two outputs totalling `124,975 B`;
- B01 structure remained `c699fc27230d8dc378a9d4e6aa23a6425cc7007c0ee33a3172b6928f8e1b7f0b`;
- BuildPlan symlink, external output and external report regressions passed 3/3.

Verdict: formal B12 true as a soft watchdog. It is not an OS sandbox or kernel hard quota.

## J-006 · Compile receipt gap audit

Type: live pre-experiment audit, 2026-08-26.

Question: can an observer independently bind a saved `.blend` and manifest to the exact BuildPlan, compiler, Blender binary, budget profile and OCIO config?

Observation:

- `scene.manifest.json` v0.1 contains structure, structure hash, warnings and telemetry;
- it does not contain the BuildPlan hash or runtime/toolchain identity;
- B12 records budget-profile identity but does not bind every input/tool/output into one self-verifying artifact;
- current local SHA-256 values include compiler `3b73b281…bea51`, restricted runner `f93798b3…86b3`, budget profile `9203aba8…eebe`, OCIO `24ec8184…ad15`;
- the Blender executable is a real `183,237,520 B` binary with build hash `fbe6228777e7`.

Decision: pre-register B13 CompileReceipt before implementation. The receipt hash is tamper evidence, not a cryptographic signature or remote attestation.

## Journal rule for future work

Every promoted result must record:

1. hypothesis or question;
2. frozen gate before execution;
3. exact real-Blender/runtime identity;
4. positive and negative observations;
5. falsified assumptions and non-claims;
6. machine-readable artifact paths;
7. the next unresolved boundary.
