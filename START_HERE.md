# BlenderFilmStudio — new machine cold start

> **Current decision:** F0.1 through F0.5 passed on the admitted M2 Max host.
> F0.4 attempts 01 and 02 remain retained `FAIL` results. Attempt-01 proved
> canonical-exact B01/B02 BuildPlans and all four negative controls, then found
> a missing OCIO launch binding. Attempt-02 fixed only that binding and built
> B01, but the frozen full structure hash differed because it includes the
> product build hash. Attempt-03 versioned semantic structure separately from
> exact product provenance and closed F0.4 as `PASS`. F0.5 attempt-01 remains
> a retained preview setup `FAIL`; attempt-02 preserved the same thresholds and
> closed F0.5 as `PASS`. F0.6 is next; do not
> assume the fork is viable until F0.1-F0.7 all close.

This is the authoritative handoff for a fresh Codex session. The repository is
both a research notebook and an executable evidence base. Read this page,
`AGENTS.md`, and the machine-readable state before doing anything expensive.

## Where the project stands

- **Latest direction:** direct official Blender thin fork; Bforartists is a UI
  and fork-maintenance reference; an external shell remains the fallback.
- **Pinned engine baseline:** official `v5.2.0` at
  `fbe6228777e7d9afefcd61a413844e790ae75db7`.
- **Active experiment:** `F0-SOURCE-FEASIBILITY`, F0.6 upstream merge-drill
  preregistration. No merge is authorized before the target/corpus, timing
  method, conflict ceiling, patch-surface ceiling and regression matrix are frozen.
- **Closed gates:** `F0.1 PASS`, `F0.2 PASS`, `F0.3 PASS`, `F0.4 PASS` and `F0.5 PASS`. Two clean official builds reported Blender
  5.2.0 and the pinned source hash. The bundles are semantically identical but
  not byte-for-byte reproducible; the bounded differences are recorded in
  `F0.1-2026-08-29-mac-m2max-attempt-07/comparison.json`.
- **Independent identity:** the 13-path / 110-line identity patch builds as
  `Film Studio Engine F0`, uses `studio.ainativefilm.f0`, and resolves user
  state under `FilmStudioEngineF0`. Save, reset and GUI launch left the
  official Blender configuration root absent; the accepted receipt is in
  `F0.2-2026-08-29-mac-m2max-attempt-02/verdict.json`.
- **Minimum film workspace:** the 3-path / 190-line F0.3 patch adds versioned
  typed Project / Scene / Shot / Character RNA state, a one-click SH010 Camera
  task, persistent `.blend` state and a lossless Expert Mode round-trip. The
  frozen UI task required 1 interaction versus 24 in official Blender; the
  accepted receipt is in
  `F0.3-2026-08-30-mac-m2max-attempt-01/verdict.json`.
- **Retained F0.4 attempt-01:** attempt-01 proved canonical-exact embedded B01/B02
  BuildPlans, approval ordering and four pre-mutation rejections, then failed
  formal product start 3 because `ocio.GetCurrentConfig().getName()` returned
  an empty string instead of the frozen ACES 2 config name. B02 and the fifth
  product audit were not run. The self-hashed verdict is in
  `F0.4-2026-08-30-mac-m2max-attempt-01/verdict.json`; same-ID repair is forbidden.
- **Retained F0.4 attempt-02:** the preregistered ACES 2 `OCIO` launch binding
  was exact and B01 built successfully with the frozen planHash. Its full
  structure SHA was `6084df51…`, not frozen `c699fc27…`; the sole JSON
  difference was `$.blender.buildHash` (`b47eae224b6d` versus official
  `fbe6228777e7`). Removing that provenance field made both semantic structures
  byte-exact at `0bb1caf9…`. The stop rule skipped B02 and the product audit;
  verdict self hash is `279028206e81c40ffede744313f6b40f4d97fe03d6b5d4a5d40bd0e6867651cb`.
- **Accepted F0.4 attempt-03:** manifest v0.3 keeps exact product provenance in
  `execution.blender` and hashes semantic scene structure independently. B01
  and B02 built in isolated roots at semantic hashes `e8c55fb7…` and
  `d197b024…`; both retained exact product build `b47eae224b6d`. An independent
  product process reopened both `.blend` files, cross-bound attempts 01/02 and
  passed four identity-separation attacks. Verdict self hash is
  `f2888a3b4c89df3370c13fbf28097ecb4d83a3f11f325588a12321d27f7666a3`.
- **Retained F0.5 attempt-01:** the insufficient-disk control rejected with zero
  product starts, then the first admitted preview exited before any render call
  because the harness selected PNG while the source still had
  `media_type=MULTI_LAYER_IMAGE`. No render artifact was written and the stop
  rule skipped every later stage. Verdict self hash is
  `e36afca30fc3567368ae72466c682a32ab54723300b2aa063667382b5b06c617`.
- **Accepted F0.5 attempt-02:** the preregistered correction set the preview and
  final media types explicitly without changing profiles or thresholds. Four
  admitted product starts produced one EEVEE PNG, one controlled pre-render
  SIGTERM, one recovered Cycles multilayer EXR and one zero-render independent
  audit. Expected/observed render calls were exact at 2, the preview was not
  rerendered, Combined/Depth/Normal decoded successfully, and both unsafe
  admission controls rejected before an additional product start. Verdict self
  hash is `a85a2d64bb080b89051986ad83b6489317909a6f0b7ad75b5c194a252a375e71`.
- **Inherited evidence:** B01-B62 cover structured scene compilation, Blender
  execution, safety/admission, pixels, production passes, cost, recovery and a
  three-shot cinematic attempt. These results are evidence, not a claim that
  autonomous filmmaking is solved.
- **Most important retained rejection:** B62's latest camera holdout passed all
  technical gates but failed the frozen composition threshold at frame 288.
  Source control does not replace direction or taste.
- **Unproven:** upstream merge cost, packaging, signing/notarization path and
  `.blend` round-trip isolation.

## First 30 minutes on a new Mac

1. Confirm the checkout and preserve any existing changes:

   ```sh
   git status --short
   git remote -v
   git log -1 --oneline
   ```

2. Run the read-only host admission check:

   ```sh
   node scripts/preflight-f0-source-host.mjs
   ```

   It writes nothing. `F0_HOST_PREFLIGHT_ACCEPTED` means the host has the basic
   toolchain and at least 100 GiB reserve plus a 60 GiB projected source/build
   budget. A rejection is evidence; fix or document it before cloning Blender.

3. Choose an absolute workspace outside this repository. Preview the source
   acquisition plan, then explicitly execute it:

   ```sh
   scripts/bootstrap-f0-blender-source.sh --workspace /absolute/path/to/f0-workspace
   scripts/bootstrap-f0-blender-source.sh --workspace /absolute/path/to/f0-workspace --execute
   ```

   Add `--with-dependencies` only after reviewing the plan and disk budget. The
   script refuses non-empty targets, checks out the exact commit detached, and
   verifies that dependency acquisition did not move the source revision.

4. Create a new immutable evidence root under
   `experiments/ai-native-studio-f0/`. Copy the protocol identifiers and record
   the preflight output before the first build mutation. Never reuse or replace
   another machine's root.

5. F0.1-F0.5 are closed. Before any F0.6 merge mutation, create a new immutable
   evidence root and freeze the exact fork head, upstream target
   `9e2066aef7ef7e20c142ad7bd3303138a4304c93`, merge corpus, timing method,
   conflict-path accounting, 8 person-hour / 10 path / 5000 non-generated line
   ceilings and the complete F0.1-F0.5 regression matrix. Cross-bind the
   accepted F0.5 verdict and retain its failed attempt.

## What not to do

- Do not restart B62 or create a new rendering side quest as the main task.
- Do not clone Blender inside this repository or commit build products.
- Do not begin a permanent engine repository before all F0 gates have verdicts.
- Do not copy Bforartists as a second upstream; inspect it as a reference.
- Do not give a model unrestricted `bpy`, shell or filesystem authority.
- Do not hide failed builds, relax thresholds after seeing results, or overwrite
  receipts.
- Do not use in-app browser automation while the crash guard in `AGENTS.md` is
  active.
- Do not stage unrelated worktree changes; this repository may contain the
  owner's unpublished files.

## Definition of a useful next checkpoint

The next machine should push one small, auditable F0.6 preregistration checkpoint containing:

- a unique F0.6 evidence root that cross-binds accepted F0.5 attempt-02;
- exact fork head, merge base and upstream target identities;
- a frozen merge command, test corpus and human-time accounting method;
- ceilings of 10 manually resolved paths, 8 person-hours and 5000
  non-generated fork-owned changed lines;
- a regression matrix that replays every accepted F0.1-F0.5 fixture without
  weakening prior verdicts;
- a fallback trigger that recommends the external shell if any numeric ceiling
  is exceeded;
- a journal entry and, if useful, a website update.

The scientific result may be `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`. “Still working” is
not a gate verdict; “failed with preserved evidence and a bounded next test” is.
